# Monthly Expense Tracker 📊💸

Welcome to the Monthly Expense Tracker, a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project designed to help you manage your monthly expenses efficiently!

## Project Overview 🚀

I created this project as part of my MERN stack learning journey, leveraging the following technologies:

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing expense data.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for building robust APIs.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing an interactive front-end for expense tracking.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## Getting Started 🌐

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/Rakib047/expense-tracker.git
2. Navigate to the expense-tracker Directory:
      ```bash
      
      cd expense-tracker
3. Go to the FrontEnd folder:
      ```bash
      
      cd FrontEnd
4. Install all the dependencies for the front end:
      ```bash
      
      npm install
5. Go to the BackEnd folder:
      ```bash
      
      cd ../BackEnd
6. Install all the dependencies for the back end:
       
   
       npm install
6. Start the back-end server:
       
   
       npm start
7. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5001  (make sure nothing is running on port 5001)
